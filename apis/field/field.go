// Package field defines the basic contract for structured fields in dlog.
//
// The goal of this package is to provide a minimal, implementation-agnostic
// representation of a "field" that can be attached to a log record, passed
// through a pipeline, and finally encoded by a concrete runtime (zap, slog, ...).
//
// This package intentionally does NOT depend on any logging backend.
package field

// Field represents a single structured key/value pair.
//
// Rules:
//   - Key MUST be non-empty for a field to be meaningful.
//   - Value is intentionally typed as `any` to keep the contract open;
//     concrete runtimes may apply type-based optimizations (ints, strings, ...).
//   - Field is expected to be a small, copyable value type.
//
// Field does NOT do validation on its own to keep the contract minimal.
// Validation belongs to higher-level components (record, pipeline, encoder).
type Field struct {
	// Key is the structured name of the field (e.g. "service", "correlation_id").
	Key string

	// Value is the field payload. It can be any Go value; the concrete encoder
	// decides how to serialize it (e.g. JSON encoder may inspect the type).
	Value any
}

// New creates a new Field from key and value.
// This is a convenience constructor for call sites.
func New(key string, value any) Field {
	return Field{Key: key, Value: value}
}

// Validator is an optional interface that a Field-like type can implement
// if it wants to provide semantic validation (e.g. non-empty key).
// The core dlog contracts do not require validation by default.
type Validator interface {
	Validate() error
}
