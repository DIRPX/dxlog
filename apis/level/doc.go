// Package level defines the logging severity type used across dlog.
//
// The intent of this package is to provide a small, stable set of levels
// (trace, debug, info, warn, error) together with canonical string
// representations and simple parsing/validation routines.
//
// This package is deliberately kept free from concrete logging backends
// and frameworks. Runtime packages are expected to map these levels to
// specific backends (for example, to zap or slog) as needed.
//
// Canonical forms are lowercase strings ("trace", "debug", ...). Keeping
// level formatting and parsing in this package ensures that all components
// of the system interpret configuration and serialized records in the same
// way.
