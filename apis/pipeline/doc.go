// Package pipeline declares the high-level contracts for building and
// describing a dlog logging pipeline.
//
// A pipeline in dlog is a logical sequence of processing steps that a
// log record goes through before it is finally encoded and written to one
// or more sinks. This package focuses on the *declarative* side of that
// process: it provides data structures that say “which plugins to run,
// in what order, and which sinks to fan out to”, but it does not execute
// anything by itself.
//
// The typical flow described by a Specification looks like this:
//
//  1. Run pre-processing plugins (e.g. redaction, sampling, throttling,
//     correlation/context injection).
//  2. Encode the record (implementation detail, not part of this package).
//  3. Deliver the encoded record to the configured sinks (also an
//     implementation detail).
//  4. Optionally run post-processing plugins (e.g. metrics taps).
//
// This separation lets runtime packages take a Specification produced from
// configuration (file/env/remote) and assemble an executable pipeline
// using concrete plugin registries, encoders and sinks.
//
// The pipeline package intentionally does *not* import the plugin package
// to avoid cyclic dependencies. It only defines declarative specs; the
// executable plugin contract lives in the sibling package
// "dlog/apis/pipeline/plugin".
